# Random Ideas 

## Random Ideas

- Use GAN, generative AI in combination with DP techniques
for privacy preserving data exploration
- What contributes to privacy leaking in ML? 
  - gradients (gradient similarity of two inputs)
  - overfitting (accuracy gap between training and test data)
  - model architecture (thats a tough one)
